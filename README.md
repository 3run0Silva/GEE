# GEEvents Python Course Project

Introduction:

This application aims to provide users with information about events in Geneva in a simple and intuitive way. Such information is scattered across the web, requiring searches or prior knowledge of the event.

About this project:

This project uses an MVC architecture and utilizes the following technologies:

Primary:
Python, Flask, Selenium, Firebase

Secondary:
HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

Dependencies:

Axios: $ npm install axios
Flask-cors: $ pip install -u flask-cors
Firebase-admin: $ pip install â€“user firebase-admin
The idea of the project is to scrape the web for information about events in Geneva and store them in a NoSQL database (Firebase). Once the data is stored, an API is used to manage communication between the front and back ends. Finally, a simple front end allows users to query the database for event data.

Project Environment:

Frontend:

Since the focus of the Python project is mainly on the backend, I've created a frontend using vanilla JavaScript along with HTML and basic CSS/Bootstrap for this initial phase of the project. This allows us to test our API without the need for additional tools.
